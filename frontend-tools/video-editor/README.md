## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20+) - Use `nvm use 20` if you have nvm installed
- Yarn or npm package manager

### Setup

```bash
# Navigate to the video editor directory
cd frontend-tools/video-editor

# Install dependencies with Yarn
yarn install

# Or with npm
npm install
```

## Development

The video editor can be run in two modes:

### Standalone Development Mode

This starts a local development server with hot reloading:

```bash
# Start the development server with Yarn
yarn dev

# Or with npm
npm run dev
```

### Frontend-only Development Mode

If you want to work only on the frontend with MediaCMS backend:

```bash
# Start frontend-only development with Yarn
yarn dev:frontend

# Or with npm
npm run dev:frontend
```

## Building

### For MediaCMS Integration

To build the video editor for integration with MediaCMS:

```bash
# Build for Django integration with Yarn
yarn build:django

# Or with npm
npm run build:django
```

This will compile the editor and place the output in the MediaCMS static directory.

### Standalone Build

To build the editor as a standalone application:

```bash
# Build for production with Yarn
yarn build

# Or with npm
npm run build
```

## Deployment

To deploy the video editor, you can use the build and deploy script (recommended):

```bash
# Run the deployment script
sh deploy/scripts/build_and_deploy.sh
```

The build script handles all necessary steps for compiling and deploying the editor to MediaCMS.

You can also deploy manually after building:

```bash
# With Yarn
yarn deploy

# Or with npm
npm run deploy
```
